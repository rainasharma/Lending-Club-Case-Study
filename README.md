The aim of this case study is to identify risky loan applicants using EDA, which the company can utilise for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
We will identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
